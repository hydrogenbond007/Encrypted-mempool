Choose a homomorphic encryption scheme: To implement an encrypted mempool on Solana, you will first need to choose a homomorphic encryption scheme that is well-suited to the types of computations that will be performed on the encrypted data. Some possible options include the Paillier cryptosystem, the BGV scheme, or the CKKS scheme.

Encrypt transactions as they are added to the mempool: When a transaction is submitted to the mempool, it should be encrypted using the chosen homomorphic encryption scheme. This will require generating a public key that can be used to encrypt the transaction.

Store the encrypted transactions in a database: Encrypted transactions should be stored in a database that is optimized for efficient search and retrieval. Solana's built-in database, called "RocksDB", may be suitable for this purpose.

Process encrypted transactions: When a block is created, the transactions in the mempool must be decrypted in order to be included in the block. This can be accomplished by using the corresponding private key to decrypt the transactions. Once the transactions are decrypted, they can be processed as usual.

Consider performance and scalability: Encrypted mempools may require more computational resources than traditional mempools, so it's important to consider performance and scalability when designing the system. You may need to implement optimizations such as caching or sharding to ensure that the system can handle a high volume of transactions.

Test and iterate: Once the encrypted mempool is implemented, it's important to test it thoroughly and iterate based on the results. You may need to adjust parameters such as the encryption scheme, database configuration, or performance optimizations in order to achieve optimal performance.
